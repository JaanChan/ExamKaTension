🔬 Chapter: The Fundamental Unit of Life
📚 Subject: Biology
💡 Core Idea: To understand that the cell is the basic structural and functional unit of life and explore its structure, organelles, and functions.

🧫 What is a Cell?
The cell is the smallest unit of life that can perform all life processes. All living organisms are made up of cells.

Discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665.

Cell Theory (Schleiden & Schwann):

1. All living beings are made of cells.


2. The cell is the basic unit of life.


3. All cells arise from pre-existing cells (Rudolf Virchow).

🔍 Types of Organisms Based on Cell Number

Unicellular – Made of one cell (e.g., Amoeba, Paramecium)

Multicellular – Made of many cells (e.g., Plants, Animals)



---

🔄 Types of Cells

Prokaryotic Cells – No well-defined nucleus, no membrane-bound organelles (e.g., Bacteria)

Eukaryotic Cells – True nucleus, membrane-bound organelles (e.g., Plant and Animal cells)

🏗️ Structure of a Cell

1. Cell Membrane / Plasma Membrane

Semi-permeable, controls entry and exit of substances.

Made of lipids and proteins.



2. Cell Wall (only in plant cells)

Rigid outer layer made of cellulose.

Provides protection and shape.



3. Cytoplasm

Jelly-like substance where all organelles are suspended.

Site of many biochemical reactions.



4. Nucleus

Control center of the cell.

Contains DNA, chromosomes, and nucleolus.

Surrounded by a nuclear membrane.

🔬 Cell Organelles

1. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)

Rough ER – Has ribosomes, synthesizes proteins.

Smooth ER – Synthesizes lipids and detoxifies poisons.



2. Golgi Apparatus

Modifies, packages, and transports proteins and lipids.



3. Lysosomes

Contain digestive enzymes.

Known as “suicide bags”.



4. Mitochondria

Site of cellular respiration.

Produces energy (ATP).

Known as the “powerhouse of the cell”.



5. Plastids (only in plant cells)

Chloroplasts – Contain chlorophyll, perform photosynthesis.

Chromoplasts – Give color to fruits and flowers.

Leucoplasts – Store starch, oils, and proteins.



6. Vacuoles

Storage sacs for water, food, and waste.

Large and central in plant cells; small in animal cells.



7. Ribosomes

Sites of protein synthesis.

Found free in cytoplasm or on Rough ER.



8. Centrosome / Centrioles (only in animal cells)

Helps in cell division.

⚙️ Differences Between Plant and Animal Cells

Plant cells have cell walls, large vacuoles, and plastids.

Animal cells have centrioles and small vacuoles, but no cell wall or plastids.



---

🧬 Chromosomes and DNA

Chromosomes are thread-like structures made of DNA.

DNA carries genetic information and controls heredity.

📌 Conclusion
The cell is the structural and functional unit of life. Its organelles work together to maintain life processes. Understanding cells helps in studying diseases, genetics, and biotechnology.

🌱 Chapter: Tissue
📚 Subject: Biology
💡 Core Idea: To understand how cells are organized into tissues in multicellular organisms, with a focus on plant and animal tissues and their functions.

🧬 What is a Tissue?
A tissue is a group of similar cells performing a specific function. Tissues increase the efficiency of an organism by performing division of labor.


---

🌿 Plant Tissues
Plants have two main types of tissues: Meristematic (growth) and Permanent (support, storage, transport).


---

1️⃣ Meristematic Tissues
Actively dividing cells found in growing regions of the plant.

Apical Meristem: At root and shoot tips; causes increase in length

Lateral Meristem: Found in sides of stems and roots; increases thickness

Intercalary Meristem: Found at leaf and stem base; causes growth between mature tissues



---

2️⃣ Permanent Tissues
Cells that have lost the ability to divide and are specialized for specific functions.

A. Simple Permanent Tissue – Made of similar cells

Parenchyma: Living cells, thin-walled, stores food; some have chlorophyll (called chlorenchyma)

Collenchyma: Living cells, irregularly thickened corners, provide flexibility

Sclerenchyma: Dead cells, thick-walled, provide strength and support


B. Complex Permanent Tissue – Made of different types of cells, work together

Xylem: Transports water and minerals

Components: Tracheids, vessels, xylem parenchyma, xylem fibers


Phloem: Transports food

Components: Sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem parenchyma, phloem fibers

🐾 Animal Tissues
Four main types: Epithelial, Connective, Muscular, and Nervous.


---

1️⃣ Epithelial Tissue
Forms covering or lining of body surfaces and organs.

Simple Squamous: Thin, flat; in lungs

Cuboidal: Cube-shaped; in kidney tubules

Columnar: Tall, column-like; in intestine

Ciliated: Columnar with cilia; in respiratory tract

Stratified: Layers of cells; in skin



---

2️⃣ Connective Tissue
Connects, binds, and supports body parts.

Areolar: Fills space between organs

Adipose: Stores fat

Ligaments: Connect bone to bone

Tendons: Connect muscle to bone

Cartilage: Smooth and elastic, at joints

Bone: Hard, supports body

Blood: Fluid connective tissue, transports substances



---

3️⃣ Muscular Tissue
Responsible for movement. Cells are long and contractile.

Striated (Skeletal): Voluntary, striped, attached to bones

Smooth (Unstriated): Involuntary, spindle-shaped, in internal organs

Cardiac: Involuntary, branched, found in heart



---

4️⃣ Nervous Tissue

Composed of neurons (nerve cells)

Transmits signals between brain, spinal cord, and body

Consists of axon, dendrites, and cell body



---

📌 Conclusion
Tissues are essential for multicellular organisms to carry out specialized functions. Plants have mainly supportive and transport tissues, while animals have more complex tissue systems for coordination, movement, and communication.

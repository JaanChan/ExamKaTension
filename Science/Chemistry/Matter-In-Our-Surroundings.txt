🧪 Chapter: Matter in Our Surroundings
📚 Subject: Chemistry
🔍 Core Idea: Everything around us is made of matter, and matter exists in different physical states based on how its particles behave.


---

🔹 What is Matter?

Definition:
Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space.

Examples:
Air, water, stone, wood, metals, clothes, etc.


---

🔹 Characteristics of Particles of Matter

1. Particles of Matter are Very Small:

They are so small that they cannot be seen with naked eyes.

Example: A single grain of salt contains millions of particles.



2. Particles of Matter Have Spaces Between Them:

This space is known as interparticle space.

The space varies from state to state (maximum in gases, minimum in solids).



3. Particles of Matter are Continuously Moving:

They possess kinetic energy.

Heating increases this movement.



4. Particles of Matter Attract Each Other:

The force of attraction varies in solids, liquids, and gases.

Strongest in solids, weakest in gases.


---


🔄 Visualize:
Imagine particles packed tightly in a solid, loosely in a liquid, and scattered in a gas.


---

🔹 Can Matter Change Its State?

Yes. Matter can change from one state to another on the application or removal of heat or pressure.


---

🔹 Change of State of Matter

1. Melting (Fusion):

Solid to Liquid (e.g., Ice → Water)

Occurs at melting point.



2. Freezing:

Liquid to Solid (e.g., Water → Ice)



3. Boiling/Vaporization:

Liquid to Gas (e.g., Water → Steam)

Occurs at boiling point.



4. Condensation:

Gas to Liquid (e.g., Steam → Water)



5. Sublimation:

Solid directly to Gas (e.g., Camphor, Dry Ice)



6. Deposition:

Gas directly to Solid (reverse of sublimation)





---

🔹 Effect of Temperature on State Change

Heating increases the kinetic energy of particles.

Overcomes the force of attraction between them.

Thus, solid melts, and liquid vaporizes.



---

🔹 Latent Heat

Definition:
Heat energy required to change the state of a substance without any change in its temperature.

Types:

Latent Heat of Fusion: Solid → Liquid
(e.g., Ice at 0°C requires energy to become water at 0°C)

Latent Heat of Vaporization: Liquid → Gas
(e.g., Water at 100°C needs extra heat to become steam at 100°C)



---

🔹 Effect of Pressure on State of Matter

Increasing pressure can turn gas into liquid.

Example: LPG cylinders – gas compressed into liquid under pressure.

Decreasing pressure can convert liquids into gases.



---

🔹 Evaporation

Definition:
The process by which liquid turns into vapor at any temperature below its boiling point.

Factors Affecting Evaporation:

1. Surface Area – More area, faster evaporation.


2. Temperature – Higher temp = faster evaporation.


3. Humidity – Lower humidity = faster evaporation.


4. Wind Speed – Higher speed = faster evaporation.



Daily Life Examples:

Wet clothes dry faster in sunlight and wind.

Water cools in an earthen pot due to evaporation.



---

🔹 Evaporation Causes Cooling

When a liquid evaporates, it takes energy from its surroundings.

This lowers the temperature of the surroundings.

Example: Rubbing alcohol or perfume feels cool.



---

🔹 Plasma and Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)

Apart from solid, liquid, and gas, there are two more states:

1. Plasma:

Found in stars and neon lights.

Ionized gas – highly energetic particles.



2. BEC (Bose-Einstein Condensate):

Discovered by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein.

Occurs at extremely low temperatures (~0 K).

Atoms come together and behave as a single quantum entity.

🔹 Important Terms & Definitions

Term	Definition

Matter - Anything that has mass and occupies space.

Melting Point - Temperature at which solid becomes liquid.

Boiling Point - Temperature at which liquid becomes gas.

Latent Heat - Heat required to change state without temperature change.

Sublimation - Direct change from solid to gas.

Evaporation - Slow vaporization at room temperature.

📝 Summary Points

Matter exists in three major physical states.

Particle behavior (movement, attraction) defines these states.

Matter can change state with temperature or pressure.

Evaporation causes cooling and depends on several factors.

Plasma and BEC are advanced states studied under extreme conditions.

🧪 Chapter: Is Matter Around Us Pure?
📚 Subject: Chemistry
💡 Core Idea: To understand the types of substances around us, distinguish between pure substances and mixtures, and learn techniques to separate the components of mixtures.

🧼 Pure Substances
A pure substance consists of only one kind of particle and has a fixed composition. Its properties remain uniform throughout.

🔹 Types of Pure Substances

🧲 Elements: Cannot be broken down into simpler substances. (e.g., 🧪 Hydrogen, ⚙️ Iron)

🔗 Compounds: Two or more elements chemically combined in a fixed ratio. (e.g., 💧 Water, 🌫 Carbon dioxide)



---

🌀 Mixtures
Mixtures contain two or more substances physically combined. Their composition can vary and can be separated by physical methods.

🔹 Types of Mixtures

🌊 Homogeneous Mixtures: Uniform composition throughout (e.g., sugar in water)

🥄 Heterogeneous Mixtures: Non-uniform composition (e.g., sand in water)



---

🥤 Solutions
Solutions are homogeneous mixtures where one substance dissolves in another.

🧂 Solute: Substance that gets dissolved

💧 Solvent: Substance that dissolves the solute


Properties:
✅ Clear appearance
✅ Cannot be separated by filtration
✅ No Tyndall effect (no scattering of light)


---

🌫 Suspensions
Suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures with visible particles that settle over time.

Properties:
👀 Particles are visible
🔦 Show Tyndall effect
🧃 Can be separated by filtration


---

☁️ Colloids
Colloids have particles larger than solutions but smaller than suspensions. They appear uniform but are heterogeneous.

Properties:
🌈 Show Tyndall effect
🚫 Do not settle on standing
🧪 Cannot be filtered


---

🧰 Separation Techniques

🔍 Filtration: Solid-liquid separation

🔥 Evaporation: Recovering solute from solution

💨 Distillation: Based on different boiling points

🧊 Sublimation: Solid to gas without liquid stage

🌀 Centrifugation: Based on particle density

🖍 Chromatography: Separation of colored components



---

⚗️ Physical vs Chemical Changes

Physical Change: No new substance, reversible (e.g., melting)

Chemical Change: New substance formed, irreversible (e.g., rusting)



---

📌 Conclusion
Most of the matter we encounter daily is a mixture. Understanding whether it is pure or impure and knowing how to separate it helps in purification and effective utilization in science and industry.

🏃‍♂️ Chapter: Motion
📚 Subject: Physics
💡 Core Idea: To study how objects move, the types of motion, and how quantities like speed, velocity, and acceleration describe motion.

🔁 What is Motion?
An object is said to be in motion if it changes its position with respect to time and a reference point.


---

📌 Types of Motion

Translatory Motion: Object moves from one place to another

Rectilinear Motion: Along a straight line

Curvilinear Motion: Along a curved path

Circular Motion: Along a circular path

Rotatory Motion: Spins about its own axis

Oscillatory Motion: To and fro motion (e.g., pendulum)

📏 Distance and Displacement

Distance: Total path length covered (scalar)

Displacement: Shortest path between initial and final position (vector)


Example: If you walk 10 m forward and 10 m back,
Distance = 20 m, Displacement = 0 m


---

⚡ Speed and Velocity

Speed = Distance / Time (Scalar)

Velocity = Displacement / Time (Vector)

Same direction as displacement



Uniform Speed: Same speed throughout motion
Non-uniform Speed: Speed changes with time


---

📈 Acceleration
Rate of change of velocity

> Acceleration (a) = (Final velocity – Initial velocity) / Time



Positive acceleration: Velocity increases

Negative acceleration (deceleration): Velocity decreases



---

🧮 Equations of Uniformly Accelerated Motion

1. v = u + at


2. s = ut + ½ at²


3. v² = u² + 2as



Where:

u = Initial velocity

v = Final velocity

a = Acceleration

t = Time

s = Displacement

📊 Graphical Representation of Motion

Distance-Time Graph

Straight line → Uniform speed

Curved line → Non-uniform speed


Velocity-Time Graph

Straight line → Uniform acceleration

Area under graph = Displacement




---

🧲 Uniform vs Non-uniform Motion

Uniform Motion: Equal distance in equal intervals of time

Non-uniform Motion: Unequal distances in equal intervals of time



---

📌 Conclusion
Motion describes how things move and allows us to predict future positions. Understanding motion is essential in studying mechanics, engineering, and everyday phenomena like driving, running, or falling objects.
